//! saltyc — SaltyOS C Standard Library
//! SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only
//!
//! Rust implementation of a C standard library for SaltyOS. Provides POSIX
//! and BSD-compatible C functions for ported userland programs (FreeBSD ls,
//! cat, etc.). All public functions use `#[unsafe(no_mangle)] pub extern "C"`
//! for C ABI compatibility and are linked into executables via `libsalty.so`.
//!
//! System operations (file I/O, memory management, process control) are
//! delegated to `libsalty`, which communicates with kernel services via IPC.
//! Core subsystems (malloc, errno) are thread-safe via spinlocks and TLS.
//! stdio FILE operations are not yet fully locked.
